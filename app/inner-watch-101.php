						<div class="text-block"><strong>Balance Wheel:</strong> a weighted wheel triggered by the hairspring that moves the hands forward in a mechanical watch by spinning back-and-forth, producing momentum to operate the escape lever and keep consistent and accurate time</div>
						<div class="text-block"><strong>Bezel:</strong> the ring that surrounds and keeps the crystal, glass, or plastic of the watch in place, sometimes holding gems, diamonds or displaying a function for pilots or divers.
